//Multiple inheritance is a feature of some object-oriented computer 
//programming languages in which an object or class can inherit 
//features from more than one parent object or parent class. 
//It is distinct from single inheritance, where an object 
//or class may only inherit from one particular object or class.

//An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods.


// Real life example:

public class MultipleInheritance {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		

	}

}
